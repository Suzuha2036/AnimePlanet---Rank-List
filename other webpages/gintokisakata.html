        <h2>Gintoki Sakata</h2>
        <hr>
 <p>
While usually coming across as lazy, selfish, greedy, and an overall jerk, Gintoki is a true hero who defends those who cannot fight for themselves and always keeps his promises to protect others and especially those close to him. He is a jack of all trades who runs his own business called the Yorozuya, who take on all manners of jobs for a small fee. He runs this business alongside his two friends, a young samurai-in-training Shimura Shinpachi and the young alien girl Kagura.

  What makes Gintoki such a great character is his irreverent humor and unwavering loyalty to his friends. Despite his laid-back attitude and love for sweets, Gintoki is a formidable swordsman with a fierce sense of justice, always willing to stand up for what's right—even if it means putting his own life on the line.
<br><br>
  But Gintoki's charm goes beyond his sword skills and sense of humor. Beneath his sarcastic exterior lies a deeply complex character with a tragic past. As the series progresses, viewers are treated to glimpses of Gintoki's past and the events that shaped him into the man he is today, adding layers of depth and nuance to his character.
