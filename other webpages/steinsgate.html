<h4>Plot</h4>
<hr>
<p>
  Steins;Gate is an adaptation of the visual novel of the same name. It is set in 2010 in Akihabara,
   Tokyo, and follows Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist", who runs the "Future Gadget Laboratory" in an apartment together with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru "Daru" Hashida. 
   <br><br>While attending a conference about time travel, Okabe finds the dead body of Kurisu Makise, a neuroscience researcher; he sends a text message about it to Daru and later discovers that 
   Kurisu is alive and that the message arrived before he sent it. <br><br> The laboratory members learn that the cell phone-operated microwave oven they are developing can send text messages back in time;
   they are joined by Kurisu, and investigate it, sending text messages – referred to as "D-mails" – to the past to change the present. Kurisu eventually creates a device that can send memories through the microwave oven, 
   effectively allowing the user to time travel.
