        <h2>Arsene Lupin III</h2>
        <hr>
 <p>
  Lupin is acknowledged by virtually every law agency on earth as the world's number one thief. Often in his adventures, he and his colleagues, Daisuke Jigen and Goemon Ishikawa XIII, will take it upon themselves to foil other criminals engaged in more violent crimes. While first glance may imply Lupin as fun-loving, flighty, perhaps even "goofy", his surface façade overcoats a brilliant imagination and a thorough knowledge of a hundred varying sciences. Forever extemporizing and reevaluating, Lupin has been responsible for heists no right-minded individual would believe possible. While arrested and jailed on numerous occasions, typically by his nemesis Inspector Zenigata, he has always managed to escape. He has a fondness for fancy gadgets from time to time plus hands-on experience in many skills a thief would find useful. His infatuation with Fujiko Mine is perhaps his most significant weakness, as it lands him in undesirable situations most of the time.
<br><br>
  His infamy has its inevitable pitfalls. Over his career, though he is guilty of many crimes, he has been framed for crimes he didn't commit by impostors, copycats and other such unsavory types committing crimes in his name, and even once had a near-exact clone produced of himself, which seriously unnerved him to the point of him wondering whether he was his actual self.
