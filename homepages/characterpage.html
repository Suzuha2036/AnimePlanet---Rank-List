            <p>
              Lupin III is the grandson of gentleman thief Ars√®ne Lupin. He is
              the world's most wanted thief and a genius criminal mastermind. He
              is an expert in making schemes and plots to steal precious objects
              that are heavily guarded and seemingly impossible to be stolen. He
              sometimes appears incompetent, but mostly as a charade to catch
              his opponents off guard. While he has been arrested and thrown in
              jail on a number of occasions, he has always managed to break out.

              spirit or demon in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism) due to his
