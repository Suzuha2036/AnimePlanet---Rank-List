              The eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe has
              become a shell of his former self. Depressed and traumatized after
              failing to rescue his friend Makise Kurisu, he has decided to
              forsake his mad scientist alter ego and live as an ordinary
              college student. Surrounded by friends who know little of his time
              travel experiences, Okabe spends his days trying to forget the
              horrors of his adventures alone.

              In the year 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a
              hyperspace gateway that made Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity
              has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar
              System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police
              (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered
              bounty hunters (also referred to as "Cowboys") chase criminals and
              bring them in alive in return for a reward.

              In the blink of an eye, thirty thousand bewildered Japanese gamers
              are whisked from their everyday lives into the world of the
              popular MMORPG, Elder Tale, after the game's latest update—unable
              to log out. Among them is the socially awkward college student
              Shiroe, whose confusion and shock lasts only a moment as, a
              veteran of the game, he immediately sets out to explore the limits
              of his new reality.

              It is the year 1986. Dr. Kenzō Tenma, an elite neurosurgeon
              recently engaged to his hospital director's daughter, is well on
              his way to ascending the hospital hierarchy. That is until one
              night, a seemingly small event changes Tenma's life forever; while
              preparing to perform surgery on a working-class Turkish man, he is
              ordered by the hospital director to switch patients and instead
              perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous opera singer.

              Edo is a city that was home to the vigor and ambition of samurai
              across the country. However, following feudal Japan's surrender to
              powerful aliens known as the "Amanto," those aspirations now seem
              unachievable. With the once-influential shogunate rebuilt as a
              puppet government, a new law is passed that promptly prohibits all
              swords in public. Enter Gintoki Sakata, an eccentric silver-haired
              man who always carries around a wooden sword and maintains his
              stature as a samurai despite the ban. As the founder of Yorozuya,
              a small business for odd jobs, Gintoki often embarks on endeavors
              to help other people—though usually in rather strange and
              unforeseen ways.

              Fifteen years after a cataclysmic event known as the Second
              Impact, the world faces a new threat: monstrous celestial beings
              called Angels invade Tokyo-3 one by one. Mankind is unable to
              defend themselves against the Angels despite utilizing their most
              advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human
              salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization
              led by the cold Gendou Ikari. NERV operates giant humanoid robots
              dubbed "Evangelions" to combat the Angels with state-of-the-art
              advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror
              Fields.

              In the year 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia is establishing
              itself as a dominant military nation, starting with the conquest
              of Japan. Renamed to Area 11 after its swift defeat, Japan has
              seen significant resistance against these tyrants in an attempt to
              regain independence. Lelouch Lamperouge, a Britannian student,
              unfortunately finds himself caught in a crossfire between the
              Britannian and the Area 11 rebel armed forces. He is able to
              escape, however, thanks to the timely appearance of a mysterious
              girl named C.C., who bestows upon him Geass, the "Power of Kings."
              Realizing the vast potential of his newfound "power of absolute
              obedience," Lelouch embarks upon a perilous journey as the masked
              vigilante known as Zero, leading a merciless onslaught against
              Britannia in order to get revenge once and for all.

              Yoichi Isagi was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would
              have sent his high school soccer team to the nationals, but a
              split-second decision to pass the ball to his teammate cost him
              that reality. Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if
              the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass.
              When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan
              Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased
              decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18
              strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock.
